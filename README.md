# ecommerce-page

An full ecommerce project that I created thanks to the lessons learned in Codecademy and Coding with Basir. The design of the home page is a design made by a Kevin Powel turotial.

Here is a video Demo of the app: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LL5EgdTixNs8TrJPE65yoh2wwrcF35KI/view?usp=sharing

The challenge was the following:
I took this html and CSS project I did with a Kevin Powel tutorial and turn it into a responsive, full ecommerce website using nothing but VANILLA Javascript.
